    //Deferred publisher is only used for future since future is the only publisher that can execute immediately. All other publishers will nto published without a subscriber
    
    //Turn existing API calls into Publishers
    //using Deferred { Future{...}} pattern is a great way to wrap APIs that are not converted to use Combine publishers. THis mean you can wrap your data store calls with this patter and then be able to attach operators and sinks to them. You can also use it for many of Apples Kits where yo need to get information from the device/user permission
